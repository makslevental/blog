Bit manipulation is useful for things like creating bit sets (which are themselves useful for representing membership efficiently).

## Formulae

$$ \&, \vert, ^\widehat{}  $$ are the **and**, **or**, and **xor** operations.

Integers are represented using **two's complement**, which simply means the opposite of an integer is calculated by inverting all of the bits and then adding 1:

$$ -x ~= ~\sim x + 1 $$

where $\sim$ is the bit-inversion operator ( $ 10101 \rightarrow 01010 $ ). Simpler mnemonic is probably $ \sim x = -x -1 $.

$$ x >> k $$ means dividing $x$ by $2^k$ with truncation (rounding down) and  $$ x << k $$ means multiplication by $2^k$. A **bitmask** is $$ 1 << k $$, i.e. a word with $1$ in the $k$-th position of its bit representation.

## Representing sets

Every subset of $$ \left\{0, 1, 2, \dots, n - 1 \right\} $$ can be represented by an $n$-bit integer whose $1$ bits indicate which element belongs to the set. For example, using a 32-bit integer

$$00000000000000000000000100011010$$

represents $$ \left\{1, 3, 4, 8\right\} $$

In python

```python
    members = 0
    members |= 1 << 1
    members |= 1 << 3
    members |= 1 << 4
    members |= 1 << 8
    print("{0:032b}".format(members))
    # 00000000000000000000000100011011 
```

## Set operations

$$

A \cap B \iff A ~\&~ B \\
A \cup B \iff A ~\vert~ B \\
\bar{A} \iff \sim A \\
A - B \iff A ~\& \left(\sim B\right)
A \triangle B \iff A ^\widehat{} B
$$

## Working with subsets

```python
def all_subsets(n):
    for b in range(1<<n):
        print("{0:0b}".format(b))
        
        
def all_k_subsets(n):
    for b in range(1<<n):
        if bin(b).count('1'):
            print("0:0b".format(b))

def all_subset_of(x):
    b = 0
    while (b-x) & x:
        print("{0:0b}".format(b))
        b = (b-x) & x
    print("{0:0b}".format(x))
```
