For an $n$-dimensional manifold, around every point there is a simply-connected open set, the *coordinate patch*, and a one-to-one continuous function, the *coordinate function* or *chart*, mapping every point in that open set to a tuple of $n$ real numbers, the *coordinates*.

$$
    \bm{x} := \left( x^0, x^1, \dots, x^n \right) = \chi(\textsf{m})
$$

where $\bm{x}$ is actually a tuple and $\textsf{m}$ is a point in the manifold.
The individual coordinates are identified using superscripts

$$
    x^i = \chi^i (\textsf{m})
$$
