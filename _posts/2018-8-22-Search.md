# Generating subsets

Alternatively choose to include and not include element from array and branch (making sure to undo the last move after both branches).

```python
def all_subsets(A):
    n = len(A)
    subset = []
    def search(k):
        if k == n:
            print(subset)
        else:
            # don't push
            search(k+1)
            subset.append(A[k])
            search(k+1)
            # undo push
            subset.pop()
    search(0)
    
```

# Generating permutations

Given a substring that is the last permutation (lexically last) change that string the least; i.e. swap the next character into the smallest place it can go and then reverse the string.

```python
def next_perm(A):
    n = len(A)
    # find longest tail weakly decreasing
    i = n - 1
    while i-1 > 0 and A[i-1] >= A[i] :
        i -= 1
    # A[i-1] < A[i]
    j = i-1
    while i < n and A[j] <= A[i]:
        i += 1
    # A[j] > A[i] so swap
    A[j], A[i-1] = A[i-1], A[j]
    # now reverse
    return A[:j+1] + reversed(A[j+1:])
```

# N Queens

Place $n$ queens on an $n \times n$ chessboard without any attacking any of the others.

<img style="margin:auto; display:block" src= "{{ "images/nqueens.png" | absolute_url }}" width="500px">

```python
    def nqueens(n):
        column = n*[0]
        diag1 = n*[0]
        diag2 = n*[0]
        
        count = 0
        def search(x):
            if y == n:
                count += 1
                return
            # iterate over the columns to look for a potential position
            for y in range(n):
                # (x,y) is on antidiagonal x+y and diagonal (x-y+n-1)
                if column[y] or diag1[x+y] or diag2[y-x+n-1]: continue
                column[y] = diag1[x+y] = diag2[y-x+n-1] = 1
                search(x+1)
                column[y] = diag1[x+y] = diag2[y-x+n-1] = 0
```
