## Bio

I'm a ~3rd year CS PhD student at University of Chicago in [Ian Foster's](https://labs.globus.org/) distributed systems group.
Broadly, my interests lie at the intersection of distributed systems and Deep Learning/Machine Learning/Computer Vision, with scientific applications.
In particular efficient parallelization of techniques such as [Blob Detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blob_detection) across GPU clusters.
This includes image recognition and classification for imagery produced by scientific instruments such as the [APS at ANL](https://www.aps.anl.gov/Beamlines).
Currently I'm working on the [BlindML](https://github.com/TheDataStation/blindml/) components of the [Data Station](https://thedatastation.github.io/).

I got my MS in CS at University of Florida in [Joseph Wilson's](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/~jnw/) group where I worked on SDEs for landmine detection in GPR data. 

Before CS, I got my BS in Pure Math at Florida State University and then taught math at a secondary school in Mbale, Uganda as a Peace Corps volunteer.
